**Higher Bit, Mightier Clout: Hierarchical Importance-Aware Multi-modal Hashing**

---

## Overview

`HIAMH` proposes a novel **Hierarchical Importance-Aware Multi-modal Hashing** method for efficient multi-modal data retrieval. The method leverages hierarchical importance modeling to generate high-quality hash codes that capture significant features across modalities. It has been validated on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
